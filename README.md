# Sample Hardhat Project

This project was made by me during a solidity course of freecodecamp.org and it demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

For running this you will need RPC url of sepolia, API key of etherscan and coinmarketcap and a test account private key cointaining test ETH.
